## 🔭 Current project — Sales Data Analytics & Forecasting
I am currently building a Sales Data Analytics & Forecasting pipeline focused on helping small retailers understand historical performance and forecast short-term demand.

What I'm doing:
- Ingesting and cleaning multiple sales datasets (transactions, products, promotions)
- Exploratory Data Analysis and interactive visualizations (Plotly, Seaborn)
- Feature engineering (time features, rolling aggregates, promotion flags)
- Time-series modeling and baseline forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet) and ML regressors
- Building a lightweight dashboard (Streamlit / Dash) to visualize trends and forecasts
- Packaging the pipeline for reproducibility and deployment (Docker, CI)

This project helps demonstrate practical experience in ETL, EDA, forecasting, and deploying simple dashboards.
