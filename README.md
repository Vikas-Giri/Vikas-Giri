# 👋 Hi, I'm Vikas Giri

Aspiring Data Scientist with a passion for Python, data analytics, and SQL. I enjoy solving problems, working on data-driven projects, and contributing to open source.

---

## 🔭 What I'm working on
- End-to-end Data Analytics project: analyzing e-commerce / sales data — I handle data ingestion (CSV/SQL), cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and build visual dashboards. I am prototyping a simple forecasting model (time-series / gradient boosting) and preparing a reproducible notebook + README and a Plotly dashboard to present findings.
- LeetCode practice — strengthening algorithm and problem-solving skills
- Learning more about machine learning model deployment and MLOps

## 🛠 Skills
- Languages & Tools: Python, pandas, NumPy, SQL, Jupyter, Git
- Data: Data cleaning, EDA, visualization (Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly), basic ML workflows (scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Other: Linux basics, version control, problem solving (LeetCode)

## 📂 Selected Projects
- Ecommerce Sales Analysis — end-to-end analysis from raw sales CSVs to dashboard and basic sales forecasting (notebook + dashboard)
- LeetCode Solutions — algorithms and data structures practice (organized by difficulty and topic)
- (Add links to 2–3 repos you want to showcase or pin these repos to your profile)
