I am a data enthusiast with a strong interest in analytics and problem-solving.  
I focus on building end-to-end data analysis projects by combining **SQL, Python, and Power BI** to turn raw data into meaningful business insights.

## 🔭 Learning Path & Current Focus
I am following a structured learning path toward data analytics:

- **Power BI** → building interactive dashboards and business reports  
- **SQL** → writing analytical queries on relational databases  
- **Python** → data cleaning, analysis, and automation  

Currently, I am preparing for a **final end-to-end data analytics project** that combines **SQL + Python + Power BI** in a single workflow.
